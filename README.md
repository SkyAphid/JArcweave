# JArcweave Importer
JArcweave is an API built to help with importing exported JSON files from the [Arcweave](arcweave.com) dialogue editing program. Additionally, it was built and documented to act as a learning tool for those interested in making their own importers for various programming languages.

## Features
- Arcweave JSON Project importing: load Arcweave files into Java as a "raw" format where all of the data is preserved as is
- Arcweave Project "processing": projects can be converted with a single line into a more Java-friendly format where all of the produced Java objects are referenced directly rather than by String ID.
- Basic examples included for using the API
- Fully documented
- Text document included which summarizes the Arcweave JSON format, along with tips on expanding JArcweave's functionality
